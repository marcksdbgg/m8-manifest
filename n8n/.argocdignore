# Ignore exported workflow artifacts and non-kubernetes files under `-workflow` directories
**/*-workflow/**
# Alternatively, ignore all json files in workflow folders (keeps other json intact)
**/*-workflow/*.json
# If necessary, ignore json files globally under this path to avoid non-k8s artifacts being parsed
# Use this with caution: if you have k8s manifests in JSON format, remove or narrow this pattern.
